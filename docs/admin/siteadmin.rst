Site administrators
===================

Use the `Django admin <https://data.open-contracting.org/admin/>`__ to:

-  Add and edit publications

   .. note::

      Once a new publication is added, the :ref:`cli-manageprocess` command will collect its data, unless *Frozen* is checked.

-  Check the status of a job and its tasks

   .. note::

      The :ref:`cli-flattener` task was added in September 2022, so earlier jobs have a *Last completed task* of "exporter (4/5)".

Publications and jobs can be searched by publication country and publication title.

.. note::

   The search performs only case normalization. For example, "Montreal" will not match "Montr√©al" (with an accent).

Review publications
-------------------

From time to time, use the filters in the right-hand sidebar to:

-  Review publications for out-of-date or missing information:

   -  Non-frozen publications that weren't recently reviewed (*By last reviewed*: More than a year ago)
   -  Publications without all English and Spanish translations (*By untranslated*: Yes)
   -  Publications without licenses (*By data license*: Empty)
   -  Non-frozen publications without quality summaries (*By quality summary [en]*: Empty)
   -  Non-frozen publications without other information (*By incomplete*: Yes), one or more of:

      -  Country flag
      -  Country (en)
      -  Retrieval frequency
      -  Source URL
      -  Language (en)
      -  Description (en)
      -  Data availability (en)

-  Review publications for visibility and processing:

   -  Unpublished publications (*By public*: No)
   -  Frozen publications (*By frozen*: Yes)

Review jobs
-----------

From time to time, use the filters in the right-hand sidebar to:

-  Check for completed jobs whose temporary data has not been deleted
-  Check for running jobs that are old

   .. note::

      The *WAITING* status is not used.

.. _siteadmin-troubleshoot:

Troubleshoot a job
------------------

A job's detail page:

-  Displays the status, result and note (e.g. error messages) for each task, in the *Job tasks* section.

   If a task's result is ``FAILED``, but :func:`~data_registry.process_manager.process` considers the failure to be :class:`temporary<data_registry.exceptions.RecoverableException>`, then the :ref:`cli-manageprocess` command retries the task until it succeeds or fails permanently. Read the *Note*, and judge whether the failure is permanent. If so, you can set the job's *Status* to *COMPLETED* to stop the retries. The :ref:`cli-manageprocess` command will then delete the job's temporary data.

   The next job will be scheduled according to the publication's retrieval status. If you want it scheduled sooner, you can delete the job **ONLY IF** the last completed task is ``exporter``. If not, deleting the job could delete a Kingfisher Process collection or Pelican dataset while work is still queued in RabbitMQ, which could cause 100,000s of errors to be reported to `Sentry <https://ocdsdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html#sentry>`__.

   To delete a job in these cases, ask :doc:`sysadmin`.

-  Defines and displays metadata (*Context*) from its tasks, in the *Management* section

   Use the metadata to troubleshoot other applications. For example, to check the Scrapy log, replace the hostname and port in the ``scrapy_log`` value with ``collect.data.open-contracting.org``.
