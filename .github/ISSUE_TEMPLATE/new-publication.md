* [ ] Check that [Kingfisher Collect](https://kingfisher-collect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spiders.html) has a spider for the dataset. If not, check the [new spider](https://github.com/open-contracting/kingfisher-collect/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+spider%22) tag for an existing issue. If there is none, create a [new issue](https://github.com/open-contracting/kingfisher-collect/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+spider&template=new-spider.md&title=).
* [ ] Add the [new publication](https://data-registry.datlab.eu/admin/data_registry/collection/add/) to the data registry, to initiate its processing
* [ ] Draft the publication's description, data availability, and quality issues in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pr87zDrs9YY7BEvr_e6QjOy0gexs06dU9ES2_-V7Lzw/edit)
* [ ] Request review from the [responsible contact](https://crm.open-contracting.org/projects/ocds/wiki/Responsible_contacts) for the country, to check accuracy
* [ ] Request copy-editing from Sophie Abache
* [ ] Add the English texts for the new publication in the [admin panel](https://data-registry.datlab.eu/admin/data_registry/collection/)
* [ ] Assign Dulce (CDS) to translate the texts to Spanish
* [ ] Assign Viktor (OCP to translate the texts to Russian
* [ ] Assign Yohanna/James to double-check (1) the data processing and (2) the completed metadata in the admin panel

If all is good, Yohanna/James will mark the publication as published.
